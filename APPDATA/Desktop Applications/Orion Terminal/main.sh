#We will import the U-Shell that uses every single non-UNIX or non-DOS command. It only has tree, and about 120 buiilt-in commands. In main.py, this file will be implemented fully into a application.

# Import the U-Shell
from UShell import UShell

# Create an instance of the U-Shell
shell = UShell()

# Start the shell
shell.start()
#end
